# Converting English Hand-Drawn Chars74k Data to JSON

By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)

This is just a quick notebook to convert the stroke trajectories of the
hand-drawn English letters in the
[Chars74k](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/) dataset to JSON.
See [the notebook](chars74k-json-dump.ipynb) for more details.

You can download the JSON-converted files directly:

* [Regular](https://github.com/aparrish/chars74k-json-dump/raw/master/char74k.json)
* [Normalized](https://github.com/aparrish/chars74k-json-dump/raw/master/char74k-normalized.json)
  (translated so that each letterform is centered on the center of the strokes'
  bounding box)
